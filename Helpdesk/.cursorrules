- When the user provides ideas, details, or requests for documentation, organize them into relevant markdown files under the Helpdesk/markdown/ directory.
- Create subfolders within Helpdesk/markdown/ as needed to categorize documentation (e.g., roadmap, architecture, guides, references, etc.).
- Each document should be a markdown (.md) file with a clear, descriptive name.
- If a document fits into an existing category, add or update the relevant file; otherwise, create a new subfolder and file as appropriate.
- Maintain a README.md in Helpdesk/markdown/ that provides an overview and links to all subfolders and key documents.
- Do not remove or overwrite user content unless explicitly instructed.
- Always confirm the structure and naming conventions with the user if there is ambiguity.
- Keep documentation organized, concise, and easy to navigate.
- Use semantic, human-readable folder and file names.
- Do not include implementation code in documentation unless specifically requested.
- When in doubt, ask the user for clarification on how to organize or title a document.
