# Project Vision

This helpdesk system aims to provide a visually appealing, simple, and highly integrated support platform for IT and business operations. The core principles are:

- **Modern UI**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring a glass-inspired dark mode, teal as the main accent color, and dark grey backgrounds. The interface should be clean, easy to use, and visually engaging.
- **HTML Email Support**: Outbound notifications and updates will be sent using Resend, ensuring professional, branded communication.
- **Database**: MongoDB will be used for scalable, flexible data storage.
- **Authentication**: User roles and permissions will mirror SNIPE IT Asset Management, supporting agents, admins, owners, and customers.
- **Snipe-IT Integration**: Deep integration with the Snipe-IT API to:
  - Display assets related to user tickets
  - Automate asset and system user creation via joiner/leaver forms
  - Use dropdowns populated from Snipe-IT (departments, managers, etc.)
- **Task Management**: Replace current Microsoft Planner/Power Automate flows with a scalable, easy-to-use task management system.
